Realizing that nobody has ever had a crush on you can be a devastating realization. It can leave you feeling unlovable, unwanted, and alone. The weight of this realization can feel suffocating and it's easy to fall into a spiral of negative thoughts and self-doubt.

You may begin to wonder what's wrong with you, why you haven't been able to attract any romantic attention. You may start to compare yourself to others and feel like you don't measure up. You may feel like you're doomed to a life of loneliness and isolation. The reality is that attraction is complicated and often out of our control. It's not a reflection of your worth as a person, but it can be hard to remember that in the face of this realization, you may start to feel like you're not good enough, like you'll never find someone who loves you for who you are.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have gone through the same experience and come out on the other side. While it may be difficult to see right now, there is hope for the future. You never know who might come into your life and see you for the amazing person that you are. We have friends, family, and other loved ones who value us for who we are. Our worth is not determined by the opinions of others, but rather by our own sense of self-worth and the way we treat others.

If you are feeling down about this realization, it's important to take care of yourself. Spend time doing things that make you happy, whether it's reading a good book, going for a walk, or trying out a new hobby. Surround yourself with positive people who uplift you and make you feel good about yourself. Focus on building your self-esteem and your sense of self-worth.

Remember, just because nobody has ever had a crush on you doesn't mean that it will never happen. Keep an open mind and continue to work on yourself and your personal growth. The right person will come along at the right time, and in the meantime, focus on being the best version of yourself that you can be.
