Okay, it's been some time since I wrote last and I thought to write about my vacation in Malaysia. The planning has been going on for days after one of my friends got married back in July; A tug of Excitement. Finally, on the scheduled day(07 Aug) we boarded the Mauritius Airlines flight.

#  Day 1 - Arrival

We arrived the following day around 3 PM. It was so freaking hot, fortunately every building, cars, bus had aircon. We stayed at the [cheapest hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/my/msp.en-gb.html) we could find on booking.com in Kuala Lumpur. Although, we did not like the small bathroom and toilet, the staff was nice and they cleaned our room every 3 days giving up new towel, shampoo pillow. 

After unpacking our things, we went to 7-Eleven and grab a [malaysian sim card](https://www.u.com.my/en/personal/home). And yes ofcourse, on our very first day, it was raining so freaking much, that we had to stay around 2 hours in the same building. But luckily, the malls was so huge, even 2 hours doesn't seem enough. 

We went to [Pavillion](https://www.pavilion-kl.com/) food-court for dinner. First thing i got was Burger King, which was allrighhtt. Then I saw a place seling japansese food. Bought the Signature beed curry, and boy it was good!

# Day 2 - Batu Caves

On the second day, we went to Batu Caves to visit the Gods. We took the train at 8 am and reached there around 9 15am. Little history about the batu caves : Dedicated to Lord Murugan, this vibrant temple has a series of caves and cave temples. It is believed that the caves are said to be around 400 million years old.

And hereâ€™s the best partâ€¦there is no entrance fee! **Batu Caves is FREE**. Simply walk right up and admire whatâ€™s in front of you, snap some pictures, and then take on those 272 stairs. Even though the stairs look daunting, theyâ€™re actually not that bad, and you get some awesome views along the way.

But whether you just snap pictures from the bottom or are trudging up the stairs , watch out for the macaques! They are small monkeys that will steal your food and sometimes water bottle. Theyâ€™re fun to take photos of, but donâ€™t taunt them â€“ sometimes they bite people or take your stuff. I always clutch my camera and phone tight when theyâ€™re around. ðŸ˜…

Inside the caves there are statues and temples. You can walk freely throughout the cave. Enjoy the pics below

## New Phone

Ever since the released of the first [Nothing Phone(https://intl.nothing.tech/pages/phone-1)], I've been waiting to get my hand on the Nothing Phone 2. It was a surprise for me to find that [Low Yat](https://www.lowyat.net/) which is a shopping centre specializing in electronics and IT products do not sell the phone. So i did some research and found a store in Pavillion called[Urban Republic] (https://shop.urbanrepublic.com.my/) was selling the phone. Went there and bought it.

# Day 3 - Petaling Street Market, Jalan Alor

Jalan Petaling â€“ or the famous main road of the neighborhood called Petaling Street. Within minutes of entering, I am indeed ready to keep on walking. Both sides of the crowded road are lined with hawkers, proffering me and a hundred other tourists t-shirts, belts, bags, and at least fifty different watches. We 

We returned to KL last at night and then directly to Jalan Alor which is a vibrant and colorful street in the heart of the Bukit Bintang area.
