There’s a new sheriff in town, and his name is AI. For those who have been living under a rock in recent months, let me explain what’s going on. 

Generative AI can be compared to a master chef in a kitchen.  

Just as a chef combines ingredients in unique ways to create a new dish, generative AI combines data and algorithms to generate new outputs, such as images, text, or even music. The chef uses their creativity to explore new flavor combinations, and similarly, generative AI uses its learning and decision-making abilities to explore new possibilities and create something new and unique. Just as a chef's recipes can surprise and delight us, generative AI can also create unexpected and impressive outputs that can open up new possibilities in various fields.

Full disclosure: the above passage was written by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat),the generative AI bot that is taking over the internet, with just a little bit of editing. Just just gave it the prompt: "Explain Generative AI with a metaphor."

### So, what exactly is ChatGPT?
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a powerful language model developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that uses artificial intelligence technology to assist with language-related tasks. With ChatGPT, you can ask it to provide information, answer questions, and generate text based on your input. It's a remarkable tool that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to produce natural-sounding language. ChatGPT is the brainchild of OpenAI, a company founded by a group of individuals, including Elon Musk. The technology behind ChatGPT is based on deep learning algorithms that have been trained on a vast amount of text data. This allows ChatGPT to understand natural language and generate text that sounds like it was written by a human.

Another tool created by OpenAI is [DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2). DALL-E is a tool that can create any kind of image by simply telling it what to make. It can generate images in various styles, such as photorealistic, painterly, and collage, among others. Whether it's a panda eating briyani plate in the desert, or a baby flying to the moon , DALL-E can create these images in a matter of seconds. This tool is a boon for art directors, as it can replace the need for an illustrator to create images that meet all the required specifications.
