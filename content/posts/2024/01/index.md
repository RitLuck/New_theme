I think there's a point in blogging just because you can record your feelings and what you're doing even if you don't show it to anyone, but it's hard to come up with something to write about. There were days when I didn't think to blog about it, couldn't make any progress, or rather, didn't pick up the pen.

There must be a reason for this, I understand. Well, the ``blogging experience`` is not good, and I have been thinking about it for several months, thinking that I need to change the system and how to change it. had passed. It's hilarious.

However, in the end, I thought that perhaps the hurdle was thinking, ``If I'm going to write, I should write a proper article.``
So, I decided to post this kind of sloppy article and try to free myself from the curse of being "proper."
Aim for around 30 articles per year (2.5 articles per month).
