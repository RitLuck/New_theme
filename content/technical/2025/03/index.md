If you think Amazon Q is cool, make a game with it on the CLI and experience the AWSomeness! 

Okay, let's get right into it. From my [previous blog](https://girishluckhun.com/technical/2025/02/), I showed the basic things what Amazon Q can do.

In this blog, I will try to create a Maze Game. All I needed to do was give Amazon Q this detailed prompt: 

Remember the Flappy Bird game? well, lets try it but I'll add some new features to it to make my life more difficult.

Note that prior to this, I have no experience in Game developement. We will only use the Q cli to do everything.

Once I gave the prompt, it got right into it.

It often let me test the game to ensure that it was working as it should.
P.S I suck at my own game xD

It even created a README.md file.

Finally, it gives us the Game features and how to play the game.

Let's test it ðŸš€

And it works!! 

I died even before i start ðŸ¤£ 

But yeah, it took Amazon Q around 1 hour, maybe less to complete the game but all the testing. 
I will try to improve it but for now that it.
