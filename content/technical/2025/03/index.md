If you think Amazon Q is cool, try building a game with it on the CLI and experience the AWSomeness! 

Alright, letâ€™s jump right in. In my [previous blog](https://girishluckhun.com/technical/2025/02/), I shared the basic things you can do with Amazon Q.

In this post, Iâ€™m going one step further: Iâ€™ll be building a **Flappy Bird** â€” entirely using the Q CLI.

Remember the Flappy Bird game? well, lets try that with some new features to make my life more difficult.

**Note:** I had *zero* experience in game development before this. Everything was done through Amazon Q CLI.

Once I gave it the prompt, it immediately got to work:

It even let me test the game step by step to make sure everything was working.

P.S I suck at my own game xD

To top it off, it generated a full `README.md` file:

It also detailed all the game features and instructions:

Now itâ€™s time to test it ðŸš€

And it works!! 
I died even before i start ðŸ¤£ 

It took Amazon Q around **an hour** (maybe less) to create the entire game, including all the testing.

Iâ€™ll try to improve the game over time, but for now, thatâ€™s it.
