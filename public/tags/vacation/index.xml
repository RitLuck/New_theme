      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s been some time since I wrote last and I thought to write about my vacation in Malaysia. The planning has been going on for days after one of my friends got married back in July; A tug of Excitement. Finally, on the scheduled day(07 Aug) we boarded the Mauritius Airlines flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1---arrival&#34;&gt;Day 1 - Arrival&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We arrived the following day around 3 PM. It was so freaking hot, fortunately every building, cars, bus had aircon. We stayed at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.booking.com/hotel/my/msp.en-gb.html&#34;&gt;cheapest hotel&lt;/a&gt; we could find on booking.com in Kuala Lumpur. Although, we did not like the small bathroom and toilet, the staff was nice and they cleaned our room every 3 days giving up new towel, shampoo pillow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
