      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s a point in blogging just because you can record your feelings and what you&amp;rsquo;re doing even if you don&amp;rsquo;t show it to anyone, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to come up with something to write about. There were days when I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to blog about it, couldn&amp;rsquo;t make any progress, or rather, didn&amp;rsquo;t pick up the pen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There must be a reason for this, I understand. Well, the &lt;code&gt;blogging experience&lt;/code&gt; is not good, and I have been thinking about it for several months, thinking that I need to change the system and how to change it. had passed. It&amp;rsquo;s hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
