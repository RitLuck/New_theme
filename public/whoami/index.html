<p>I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù and don‚Äôt ever want to be. Where I ever want to put myself it would be under the ‚ÄúGeek‚Äù label. When I say Geek, I mean that I‚Äôm a guy whose imaginations are endless, likes being
simple and humble with smiling face. I personally like listening to old people&rsquo;s stories, particularly when they start talking about scary stories. üëª I always see in movies and tv shows that when an elderly person
tells a story people always roll their eyes and groan. Also in real life when my elderly teacher tells a story about when he was younger people always complain. I personally like old people‚Äôs stories. I find it interesting
to learn about life in the past. A lot of elderly people also have cool life stories. I know not everyone likes their stories but I think you should sometimes sit down and listen. It makes them feel less lonely, and you get to hear a cool story out of it. Most of the time I wear black or Dark grey polo shirt because I can‚Äôt match colours to save my life. THAT kind of Geek. I am a great lover of technology and science as well, who knows WAY too much about the world of fantasy, I can out quote absolutely anyone on Harry Potter, One piece, Naruto. While I may go on and on about my world of fantasy, I&rsquo;d rather write a blog specific to this topic.I suppose that tells you enough and more about my beliefs and the type of person that I am. If you feel we have something common, then please go ahead and message me, I&rsquo;d love to talk :)</p>
<p>I like creative stuff, like art, sewing, knitting, crocheting, also i play piano in my spare time. Above all I like cooking very much. I push doors that clearly say PULL. I walk into a room and forget why I was there, I count on my fingers in maths, I hide my pain from my best ones, I say its a long story when it is not.</p>
<p>To be frank, I do not have a big friend network but only a few countable in fingers. Honestly, I am not good for friendship, no mistakes from their side but my side because I cannot put effort into maintaining too big friends circles. It is wrong to say but the truth is, I have other priorities than impressing others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that everything happens to me for a reason. People change so that I can learn to let go, things go wrong so that I appreciate them when I&rsquo;m right, I believe lies so I eventually learn to trust no one but myself,and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.&rdquo; ‚Äï Marilyn Monroe. I am always cautious about what I wish for, and at the same time, I&rsquo;m so thankful for what I have. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not liking the idea of staying till my 60s or 70s. But who knows what tomorrow holds, as long as there&rsquo;s a tomorrow, let&rsquo;s focus on learning new stuff each day.</p>
<p>So, Why this blog and where do we go from now? Well, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to start a blog, I was just super lazy. This blog is a colletion of my findings, tutorials and stuff I find rather interesting.</p>
